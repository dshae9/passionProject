    <h1>Environmental Sustainability Practices</h1>

    <p>Currently, I am passionate about implementing sustainable practices into my daily life to lessen my
         carbon footprint on Earth. Since childhood, I have always cared about mother earth, recycling, not littering,
          vegan and vegetarian practices, bringing awareness to folks about global warming. 
          Environmental issues have always been prevalent in my life, but I think the Earth Day celebrations that we had
           during school in elementary made me realize that our time on this planet is precious, and I need do everything 
           in my power to cherish and protect it. The many strides that have been made today to reduce global pollution along 
           with advancing sustainable energy practices is what continues to inspire me.
</p>
    <p>Humanity's number one priority should be the maintenance of this earth. My passion for sustanability practices allow me
        to make earth preservation a priority. Some examples of sustainability practices that individuals can do are reducing waste and 
        consumption, recycling, reusing items until they can be recycled, using biodegradable soaps, eating out less, lessing food
        waste, and so on.
